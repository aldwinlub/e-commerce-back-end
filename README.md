# e-commerce-back-end

## Overview:
In this project, the back end application was built to complete an internet retail shop which is one of the largest sectors of the electronics industry and is also known as e-commerce.

The task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. This application was accomplished through a working Express.js API which allows the use of Sequelize in order to interact with a MySQL database. Api routes were created which allows the user to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests for the models of Category, Product, and Tag.
